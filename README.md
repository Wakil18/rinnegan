This is a custom object-oriented PHP framework that uses the MVC architectural pattern

This is created as a Personal Test project to obtain in-depth knowledge of MVC structure. I created it with the help of various articles and tutorials which will be listed once I complete the project.

In oder to use the framework, you will need to go to the ".htaccess" file -- at line 4 and change the rewrite base to your folderName/public.
